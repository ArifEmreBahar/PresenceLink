# PresenceLink
A Unity invitation framework that unifies Steam and Oculus services under one flow. It manages join intents, group presence, and room routing through a menu socket. InvitationManager oversees lifecycle, while a factory plugs in platform services. Events fire for invites, joins, and launches, ensuring smooth cross-platform multiplayer entry.
