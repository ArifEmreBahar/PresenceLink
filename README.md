# PresenceLink
A cross-platform invitation and group-presence layer for Unity that unifies Steam and Oculus flows behind a single service. It listens for join intents (in-game and app-launch), updates presence (owner/target, joinable states), and routes players into the right Photon room via a main-menu socket. A factory-backed IInvitationService plugs in platform providers, while InvitationManager + initializer/terminator handle lifecycle and fire events for sent/accepted invites.
